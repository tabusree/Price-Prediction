# House Price Prediction System

## Overview
The House Price Prediction System leverages machine learning techniques to predict the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. This project provides a comprehensive pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions.

## Features
- **Data Processing:** Handles missing values, feature scaling, and encoding of categorical variables.
- **Model Training:** Implements algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Uses metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
- **Interactive Usage:** Offers flexibility for testing with new data inputs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries (install using `requirements.txt`):
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- A dataset file (e.g., `data/house_prices.csv`) for training and testing.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd prices-predictor-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:** Place your dataset in the `data/` directory and update the path in the configuration file or script.
2. **Training the Model:** Run the `train.py` script:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```
3. **Making Predictions:** Use the trained model to make predictions with new data:
   ```
   python predict.py --input new_data.csv
   ```
4. **Evaluation:** Analyze model performance using provided scripts.
